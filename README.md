# UniverseDex
The final project Spring 2024

Names: The Trilogy of Digitalization (Raymi Vargas, Jon Hua-Phan , Max Lonergan)

Project UniverseDex is a Java software development project to create and replicate the famous Pokédex from the Pokémon video games and anime franchise. The final objective is to create an application software that acts as a Pokédex, which is a database storing information of all Pokémon in existence. The UniverseDex will seek to replicate that as accurately and realistic as possible.

Layout: 5 Pokémon per row. Each Pokémon will be listed under the section of the generation/region they are from. Example: Bulbasaur is from the first generation so he will be listed under the 1st gen or Kanto Region label.

Each Pokemon will share different properties amongst them:
International Numeric ID: Their number on the non-regional Pokédex.
Regional Numeric ID: Their number on the regional Pokédex.
Name: The name of the Pokémon (ex; Bulbasaur).
Their species: (ex; Bulbasaur is known as the “Seed Pokémon”).
Their type: Pokémon can have up to two types (typeOne, typeTwo).
Color included for the type.
Catch rate: The catch rate for the Pokémon being described
Weight: Average weight of the Pokémon being described (in lbs)
Height: Average height of the Pokémon being described (in meters)
Abilities: A text list listing all abilities of a Pokémon.
Gender: A text with the gender rate for the described Pokémon.
Picture: An image of the described Pokémon (will be loaded into the program as a directory path URL).
Voice Entry: An audio description of the Pokémon, similar to that of the anime (will be loaded into the program as a directory path URL).
Button will be included for the user to click if they want to listen to the voice entry
Website Link: A link that will lead to the website(s) where all data about this Pokémon was redacted from.
Button will be included for the user to click ig they want to visit the website
Statistic: All average based statistic for this Pokémon (health, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, Speed, Total of all other statistics)

Due to all Pokémon sharing these properties, all Pokémon loaded into the program will be an instance of a general Pokémon template class called Pokemon.
